# Welcome
This version of RouteFlow is a beta developers' release intended to evaluate RouteFlow for providing virtualized IP routing services on one or more OpenFlow switches.

You can learn more about RouteFlow in our [main page in GitHub](http://routeflow.github.io/RouteFlow/) and in our [website](https://sites.google.com/site/routeflow/).

Please be aware of POX, OpenFlow, Open vSwitch, Quagga, MongoDB, jQuery, JIT and RouteFlow licenses and terms.

# Distribution overview
RouteFlow is a distribution composed by three basic applications: RFClient, RFServer and RFProxy.

* RFClient runs as a daemon in the Virtual Machine (VM), detecting changes in the Linux ARP and routing tables. Routing information is sent to the RFServer when there's an update.

* RFServer is a standalone application that manages the VMs running the RFClient daemons. The RFServer keeps the mapping between the RFClient VM instances and interfaces and the corresponding switches and ports. It connects to RFProxy to instruct it about when to configure flows and also to configure the Open vSwitch to maintain the connectivity in the virtual environment formed by the set of VMs.

* RFProxy is an application (for POX and other controllers) responsible for the interactions with the OpenFlow switches (identified by datapaths) via the OpenFlow protocol. It listens to instructions from the RFServer and notifies it about events in the network. We recommend running POX when you are experimenting and testing your network. Other implementations in different controllers will be available soon.

There is also a library of common functions (rflib). It has implementations of the IPC, utilities like custom types for IP and MAC addresses manipulation and OpenFlow message creation.

Additionally, there's `rfweb`, an extra module that provides an web interface for RouteFlow.

# Building

RouteFlow runs on Ubuntu 12.04.

1. Install the dependencies:
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential git libboost-dev \
  libboost-program-options-dev libboost-thread-dev \
  libboost-filesystem-dev iproute-dev openvswitch-switch \
  mongodb python-pymongo
```

2. Clone RouteFlow's repository on GitHub:
```
$ git clone git://github.com/routeflow/RouteFlow.git
```

3. Build `rfclient`
```
make rfclient
```

That's it! Now you can run tests 1 and 2. The setup to run them is described in the "Running" section.

# Running
The folder rftest contains all that is needed to create and run two test cases.

## Virtual environment
First, create the default LXC containers that will run as virtual machines:
```
$ cd rftest
$ sudo ./create
```
The containers will have a default ubuntu/ubuntu user/password combination. **You should change that if you plan to deploy RouteFlow**.

By default, the tests below will use the LXC containers created  by the `create` script. You can use other virtualization technologies. If you have experience with or questions about setting up RouteFlow on a particular technology, contact us! See the "Support" section.

## Test cases

Default configuration files are provided for these tests in the `rftest` directory (you don't need to change anything).
You can stops them at any time by pressing CTRL+C.

### rftest1
1. Run:
```
$ sudo ./rftest1
```

2. You can then log in to the LXC container b1 and try to ping b2:
```
$ sudo lxc-console -n b1
```

3. Inside b1, run:
```
# ping 172.31.2.2
```

For more details on this test, see its [tutorial](https://github.com/routeflow/RouteFlow/wiki/Tutorial-1:-rftest1).

### rftest2
This test should be run with a [Mininet](http://mininet.org/) simulated network.
In the steps below, replace [guest address] with the IP address you use to access your Mininet VM.
The same applies to [host address], that should be the address to access the host from inside the VM.

1. Run:
```
$ sudo ./rftest2
```

2. Once you have a Mininet VM up and running, copy the network topology files in rftest to the VM:
```
$ scp topo-4sw-4host.py mininet@[guest address]:/home/mininet/mininet/custom
$ scp ipconf mininet@[guest address]:/home/mininet
```

3. Then start the network:
```
$ sudo mn -x --switch ovsk,datapath=user --custom mininet/custom/topo-4sw-4host.py --topo=rftest2 --controller=remote,ip=[host address],port=6633 --pre=ipconf
```

Wait for the network to converge (it should take a few seconds), and try to ping:
```
mininet> pingall
...
mininet> h2 ping h3
```
For more details on this test, see its [tutorial](https://github.com/routeflow/RouteFlow/wiki/Tutorial-2:-rftest2).

### rftest3
This test converts ip routers to mpls lsrs and lers using ldp.
This test should be run with a [Mininet](http://mininet.org/) simulated network.
In the steps below, replace [guest address] with the IP address you use to access your Mininet VM.
The same applies to [host address], that should be the address to access the host from inside the VM.

1. Run:
```
$ sudo ./rftest3
```

2. Once you have a Mininet VM up and running, copy the network topology files in rftest to the VM:
```
$ scp topo-4sw-4host.py mininet@[guest address]:/home/mininet/mininet/custom
$ scp ipconf mininet@[guest address]:/home/mininet
```

3. Then start the network:
```
$ sudo mn -x --switch ovsk,datapath=user --custom mininet/custom/topo-4sw-4host.py --topo=rftest2 --controller=remote,ip=[host address],port=6633 --pre=ipconf
```

Wait for the network to converge (it should take a few seconds), and try to ping:
```
mininet> pingall
... 
```
On xterm of h2

```
> iperf -s 12345
```

On xterm of h3

```
> iperf -c 172.31.2.100 12345 -M 100
```

USe ovs-ofctl to see packet counters increment for mpls flow entries.

For more details on this test, see its [tutorial](https://github.com/routeflow/RouteFlow/wiki/Tutorial-2:-rftest2).


# Now what?
If you want to use the web interface to inspect RouteFlow behavior, see the wiki page on [rfweb](https://github.com/routeflow/RouteFlow/wiki/The-web-interface).

If you want to create your custom configurations schemes for a given setup, check out the [configuration section of the first tutorial](https://github.com/routeflow/RouteFlow/wiki/Tutorial-1:-rftest1#configuration-file) and the guide on [how to create your virtual environment](https://github.com/routeflow/RouteFlow/wiki/Virtual-environment-creation).

If you're developing for RouteFlow, there are more advanced options and components that can be installed through the `build.sh` script. See its [source](https://github.com/routeflow/RouteFlow/blob/master/build.sh) for more information.
